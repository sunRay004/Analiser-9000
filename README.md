# Analiser-9000

its a program that takes in data, and does statistical analisis
done for a school project, dont copy the code becouse it sucks

program is provided with a small snipet of data in BrowserHistory.txt
to use your own, go to https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout
under chrome select "all chrome data included", set it to only include BrowserHistory
export only browser history, unless you want to customise the regex, but default program works with the browser history
